1)Finishing ProfStef tutorial (Yeah !)

2)Learning how to create classes/methods

We got our hands on the browser creating our first package, class and method. We followed the steps of the MOOC week 1 tutorial (plus Pharo by Exemple) to do so.

3)Preparing the debugger presentation

a) Watching videos
   *Mooc week 5 videos
   *Youtube video "Pharo 5 5 Debugging in Pharo"

b) Implementing a counter in different ways
   *First by creating the classes in the browser
   *TDD method: Creating a test and using the debugger to create missing class and methods.

c) Finding exemples to code for the presentation

We looked for good exemples to code live during our presentation to explain the debugger UI, the breakpoints and how coding in the debugger is usefull.
