> GREAT TEAM ---> "**LOUNAS** Sarra / "**SAKHIRI** Mostafa /"**YAKINE** Anass "

- We started seeing the MDL source code, and after talking with Gichet we've realized
that in order to learn MDL we should learn seaside first.
- We started a tutorial teaching seaside called 'TinyBlog' that will 
  help us understand seaside better
