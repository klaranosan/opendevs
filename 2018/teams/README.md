# How to fill your team in here

Each team has to put a directory inside here. Please, create a directory with your team's name. We expect that inside your directory you put the following structure:

 - reports/
   - member1/
     - year/month/day.txt
     - ...
   - member2/
     - ...
   - presentationLanguage.pdf
   - presentationReverseEngineering.pdf
   - ...
   
Feel free to put any documentation relative to your team, anything that could help you understand or us to understand your advance in the course.
