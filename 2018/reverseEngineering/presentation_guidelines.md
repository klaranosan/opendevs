# Presentation Guidelines

## What to show

- Estimation of size: how many classes and methods does it have? How many hierarchies?
- Entry points: How to use the library
- Main concepts and responsibilities:  What are its main objects/classes, and its main method/messages. How they interact with each other.
- Extension points: How is the library supposed to be extended. Subclasses, collaboration/composition?
- Design patterns: How and where are design patterns used?

## How to show

- Diagrams: not necessarily UML, it could be simplified UML. The important thing is to select and be clear with the concepts to show.
- Code: examples and code extracts to show some key points
- Text: comments, and phrases that would explain the reasons behind a design point.
